# MONTEREY BAY DOOR - E-Commerce Addition Plan

## **SCOPE CHANGE: Phase 1 + E-Commerce Integration**

### **Tommy's Request**
> "I would really like to be able to sell material from it like the Doug Moore and Duncan site. We sell the exact same things they do. So if there is any way to copy over the site somehow that would be awesome."

### **Strategic Analysis**

**✅ OPPORTUNITY:**
- Tommy has **direct vendor relationships** (Allegion, etc.) = competitive advantage
- **Existing inventory** - "we supply everything we install"  
- **Commercial customer base** - hotels, colleges already buying
- **B2B pricing power** - bulk orders, contractor accounts

**⚠️ COMPLEXITY:**
- E-commerce significantly increases build time/cost
- Product catalog management requires ongoing maintenance
- Payment processing, inventory sync, shipping logic
- Commercial pricing (wholesale vs. retail, account-based pricing)

### **PHASED APPROACH RECOMMENDATION**

#### **Phase 1A: Speed Launch (This Week)**
**Current Plan:** Professional credibility site with lead generation
- All 7 pages as planned
- Quote request system for large orders
- Foundation for e-commerce later

#### **Phase 1B: E-Commerce Addition (2-3 weeks)**
**After Tommy Returns:** Add shopping functionality
- Product catalog integration
- Basic cart/checkout system
- Commercial account pricing
- Vendor inventory sync

### **E-COMMERCE REQUIREMENTS**

#### **Technical Stack**
**Platform Options:**
1. **Shopify Plus** - Best for commercial B2B pricing, inventory management
2. **Custom Build** - 11ty + Stripe + custom catalog (more work, more control)
3. **WooCommerce** - WordPress-based, good B2B plugins

**Recommendation:** **Shopify Plus** for commercial features:
- Wholesale pricing channels
- Account-based ordering
- Inventory management
- B2B customer portals

#### **Pricing Strategy**
**Multiple Price Tiers:**
- **Retail Pricing** - Individual items, small quantities
- **Contractor Pricing** - Registered contractors, bulk discounts  
- **Commercial Accounts** - Large customers, custom pricing
- **Quote-Based** - Complex systems, large projects

### **REVENUE MODEL UPDATE**

#### **Original Plan:**
- Monthly: $500/month (lead gen + credibility site)

#### **E-Commerce Addition:**
- **Setup Fee:** $3,500 additional (catalog setup, e-commerce build)
- **Monthly:** $750/month (site management + e-commerce maintenance)
- **Transaction Fee:** 1% of online sales (GullStack's Stripe Connect model)

**Why Higher Pricing:**
- Product catalog management (hundreds/thousands of SKUs)
- Inventory sync maintenance  
- Customer account management
- Order processing support
- Ongoing pricing updates

### **COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS NEEDED**

**Since I couldn't find Doug Moore & Duncan:**

**Alternative E-Commerce Benchmarks:**
- **Door Hardware Genius** - Product-focused, technical specs
- **Allegion.com** - Manufacturer direct model
- **Ferguson.com** - Commercial supply model
- **Grainger.com** - B2B industrial supplies

**Research Needed:**
1. **Find Doug Moore & Duncan** - Tommy should send direct link
2. **Catalog Analysis** - What products, how organized, pricing model
3. **Feature Requirements** - Quote tools, bulk ordering, account management

### **IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN**

#### **This Week (Speed Launch)**
1. **Build credibility site** as planned (all copy ready)
2. **Add e-commerce planning** to quote request forms
3. **Infrastructure prep** for future shopping integration

#### **Next Week (Tommy Returns)**
1. **Doug Moore & Duncan analysis** - Tommy provides direct access
2. **Product catalog planning** - What inventory to include
3. **E-Commerce scoping** - Full technical requirements
4. **Pricing finalization** - Setup + monthly + transaction fees

#### **Week 3-4 (E-Commerce Build)**
1. **Platform setup** (likely Shopify Plus)
2. **Product import** from vendor catalogs  
3. **B2B pricing configuration**
4. **Testing with commercial accounts**

### **RECOMMENDATIONS**

#### **✅ DO THIS:**
1. **Proceed with Phase 1A** - Get credibility site live immediately
2. **Plan for e-commerce** but don't delay the launch
3. **Higher pricing tier** - This is enterprise-level scope
4. **Research phase** when Tommy returns with Doug Moore access

#### **⚠️ CONSIDERATIONS:**
1. **Inventory management** - How does Tommy track stock?
2. **Shipping logistics** - Commercial hardware is heavy/complex
3. **Customer accounts** - Login, pricing tiers, order history
4. **Integration needs** - Does Tommy have existing systems?

### **UPDATED TIMELINE**

**Week 1:** Speed launch (credibility site) ✅  
**Week 2:** E-commerce planning & scoping  
**Week 3-4:** E-commerce development  
**Month 2:** Launch online ordering, customer onboarding  

**Total Investment:** $4,000 setup + $750/month + 1% transaction fee  
**Expected ROI:** If just 10% of current business goes online = significant revenue

**Next Step:** Get Tommy's approval on phased approach and updated pricing before proceeding
