## COMPANY STORY SECTION

### Our Story
**Building on 30+ Years of Construction Excellence**

Monterey Bay Door was founded in 2007 as the specialized supply division of Stately Construction, a family-owned construction company serving Central California since the early 1990s. What started as a way to ensure reliable door hardware and access control systems for our own construction projects has evolved into Monterey Bay's premier commercial access control specialist.

Located in Hollister, California, we've built our reputation by handling the complex access control needs of hotels, colleges, and major commercial buildings throughout the Central Coast. When you're managing access for hundreds of hotel rooms or thousands of college students, reliability isn't optional—it's everything.

### Family Business, Enterprise Capabilities  
**Tommy** serves as General Manager and will be taking over the business from his father-in-law over the next two years, ensuring the family tradition of quality service continues. Our team combines decades of construction experience with specialized expertise in modern access control technologies.

We're proud to be the local experts who understand your business while maintaining the vendor relationships and technical capabilities typically found only with large national suppliers.

## WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT

### Direct Vendor Partnerships
**Better Pricing, Better Support**

Unlike distributors and resellers, we maintain direct relationships with major manufacturers like Allegion and other industry leaders. This means competitive pricing for our customers, faster product availability, and direct access to technical support when you need it.

### Full-Service Approach  
**One Partner, Complete Solution**

We don't just sell hardware—we provide complete solutions. From initial consultation and system design through installation, training, and ongoing maintenance, we handle every aspect of your commercial access control needs.

### Proven Project Experience
**Trusted by Major Commercial Clients**

Our portfolio includes hotels requiring complex master key systems, colleges managing thousands of student credentials, and commercial buildings with sophisticated visitor management needs. We understand the unique challenges of large-scale access control projects.

### Local Presence with Enterprise Standards
**Responsive Service, Professional Results**

Being based in Hollister means we can respond quickly when you need us, whether for emergency service calls or project consultations. But our standards and capabilities match what you'd expect from national providers.
